        <h2>What Fraud Forensic Accounting Covers</h2>
        <p>
          Fraud forensic accounting applies the investigative methodology of forensic accounting
          specifically to fraud: financial crime, financial misconduct, and dishonest conduct in both
          civil and criminal legal contexts. Unlike general forensic accountants who may focus on
          commercial disputes or valuation, fraud forensic accountants specialise in proceeds tracing,
          regulatory investigations, and financial crime expert evidence.
        </p>

        <h2>The POCA Framework: Criminal and Civil</h2>
        <h3>Criminal confiscation (Part 2)</h3>
        <p>
          The court makes a confiscation order following conviction. Benefit from criminal conduct is
          calculated on a gross proceeds basis (all proceeds, not net gain). Available assets are
          assessed. The order equals the lesser of benefit and available assets.{" "}
          <Link href="/case-types/poca-confiscation-defense">POCA confiscation defense support →</Link>
        </p>
        <h3>Civil recovery (Part 5)</h3>
        <p>
          The NCA, SFO, HMRC, or CPS applies to the High Court for a civil recovery order. No
          conviction is required. The balance of probabilities standard applies. Property obtained
          through unlawful conduct is targeted.
        </p>
        <h3>Crypto recovery (Part 5 as amended)</h3>
        <p>
          Part 5 POCA has been amended to specifically allow recovery of crypto-assets, as well as cash
          and other property types.{" "}

        <h2>Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWO)</h2>
        <p>
          A UWO is a High Court order requiring a respondent to explain the source of their wealth in
          relation to specified property worth more than $50,000. The SFO, NCA, HMRC, CPS, and FCA may
          apply. The UWO annual report published in February 2026 confirms active enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For enforcement agencies:</strong> building financial evidence establishing grounds for
          the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For respondents:</strong> tracing the audit trail of funds used for acquisition,
          proving wealth is derived from legitimate sources.{" "}

        </p>

        <h2>Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPA)</h2>
        <p>
          A DPA is an agreement between a prosecutor and a corporate whereby prosecution is deferred in
          exchange for cooperation, remediation, and financial payment. SFO 2025 guidance explicitly
          links self-reporting and full cooperation to DPA invitation.
        </p>
        <p>The DPA financial settlement comprises:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Disgorgement of profits/benefits</li>
          <li>Financial penalty (typically equal to or greater than disgorgement)</li>
          <li>Costs</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The forensic accountant quantifies benefit to the organization from misconduct: the number
          around which the entire DPA financial negotiation revolves.{" "}

        <h2>Crypto Fraud: The Emerging Frontier</h2>
        <p>
          In December 2025, the Treasury published the final draft statutory instrument bringing
          cryptoasset firms under a full financial services regulatory framework, with the new regime
          covering fungible and transferable cryptoassets coming into force in October 2027.

        <h2>The FTPF Offence: Corporate Accountability</h2>
        <p>
          The Failure to Prevent Fraud offence under ECCTA 2023 makes large organizations criminally
          liable if they fail to prevent employees committing fraud for the organization&apos;s benefit.
          In force from 1 September 2025, it applies to large bodies corporate and partnerships.
          Organizations may rely on reasonable fraud prevention procedures as a defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forensic accountants assess procedure adequacy, support corporations building compliance
          programmes, and assist in enforcement defense by analyzing whether procedures were reasonable
          in the circumstances.
