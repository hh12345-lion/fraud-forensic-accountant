        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
          A fraud forensic accountant is a specialist forensic accountant who applies investigative
          accounting expertise specifically to fraud: financial crime, financial misconduct, and
          dishonest financial conduct. They investigate the financial facts of suspected or alleged
          fraud, quantify losses, trace the proceeds of fraud through complex transaction chains, and
          provide expert evidence in civil and criminal proceedings.

        <h2>Three Contexts: Civil, Criminal & Corporate</h2>
        <h3>Civil Fraud</h3>
        <p>
          Fraud forensic accountants support civil fraud claims: tracing fraudulently obtained assets,
          quantifying losses for freezing injunction applications, and producing{" "}
          <Link href="/qualifications">CPR Part 35</Link> compliant expert reports for High Court civil
          fraud proceedings.
        </p>
        <h3>Criminal Fraud</h3>
        <p>
          In criminal proceedings, fraud forensic accountants assist defense teams by challenging POCA
          benefit calculations, identifying legitimate sources of assets, and providing expert evidence
          challenging the prosecution&apos;s financial analysis. They also support prosecution-side
          engageions.
        </p>
        <h3>Corporate / Regulatory</h3>
        <p>
          Corporations facing SFO, FCA, NCA, or HMRC investigation need forensic accountants to conduct
          internal investigations under legal professional privilege, assess the quantum of any
          wrongdoing, and prepare evidence packs for self-reporting and DPA negotiations.
        </p>
        <h2>The Legal Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>CPR Part 35 (Civil):</strong> Expert evidence in civil fraud proceedings with primary
          duty to the court.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Criminal Procedure Rules (CrPR):</strong> Expert evidence in criminal proceedings with
          equivalent duties of independence and objectivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>POCA 2002:</strong> Governs confiscation of proceeds of crime in criminal cases and
          civil recovery of unlawfully obtained property without requiring criminal conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ECCTA 2023 (FTPF):</strong> The Failure to Prevent Fraud offence makes large
          organizations criminally liable if they fail to prevent employees committing fraud for the
          organization&apos;s benefit. In force from 1 September 2025.
