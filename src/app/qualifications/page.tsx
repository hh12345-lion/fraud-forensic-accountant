        <h2>CPR Part 35 & CrPR Part 33</h2>
        <p>
          Civil expert evidence is governed by CPR Part 35. Experts owe a primary duty to the court,
          must be independent and objective, and their reports must comply with Practice Direction 35.
          The Ikarian Reefer principles establish the foundational duties applicable to all civil
          expert witnesses in fraud proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Criminal expert evidence is governed by Criminal Procedure Rules Part 33. Experts must
          provide a declaration confirming they understand their duties, have complied with the
          requirements, and that their report includes everything required for the court to understand
          their opinion. Fraud forensic accountants routinely produce reports under both frameworks.
