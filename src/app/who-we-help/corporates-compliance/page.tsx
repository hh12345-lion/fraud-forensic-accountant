        <h2>You Don&apos;t Always Know the Full Picture Yet</h2>
        <p>
          Many corporate fraud investigations begin with a suspicion, tip-off, or regulatory inquiry
          before the full scope is clear. A fraud forensic accountant helps you understand what you are
          dealing with before you decide how to respond.
        </p>
        <h2>Internal Investigations</h2>
        <p>Working under legal professional privilege (via your external legal counsel), our fraud forensic accountants:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct forensic accounting investigation of suspected fraud or misconduct</li>
          <li>Preserve and analyze financial evidence</li>
          <li>Quantify the scope and value of any wrongdoing</li>
          <li>Produce investigation reports protected from disclosure to regulators (LPP)</li>
          <li>Advise on whether self-reporting to SFO/FCA is appropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SFO Self-Reporting: The New Landscape</h2>
        <p>
          The SFO&apos;s updated 2025 guidance emphasises early engagement and full disclosure, including
          facilitating access to overseas data and waiving privilege over factual accounts as elements
          of cooperation. While self-reporting now explicitly leads to DPA invitation, disclosure
          neither automatically protects against prosecution nor guarantees reduced penalties. Fraud
          forensic accountants help corporations by quantifying the full scope of misconduct, modelling
          financial exposure (disgorgement plus penalty), preparing the financial evidence package for
          disclosure, and supporting DPA negotiation on quantum.
        </p>
        <h2>DPA Negotiation Support</h2>
        <p>
          A DPA financial settlement consists of disgorgement of profits or benefits from misconduct,
          financial penalty, and costs. Fraud forensic accountants quantify each element: the
          foundation of DPA negotiation.
        </p>
        <h2>FTPF Prevention Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          The FTPF offence requires large organizations to have reasonable fraud prevention procedures
          in place. The SFO and CPS updated joint guidance covers general principles, evidential
          considerations, and public interest factors. Fraud forensic accountants assess whether
          existing procedures are adequate and advise on improvements, building the reasonable
          procedures defense. The offence has been in force since 1 September 2025 under ECCTA 2023.
