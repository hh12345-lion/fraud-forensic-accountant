        <h2>What Defense Attorneys Need</h2>
        <p>
          A fraud forensic accountant who understands both forensic accounting and criminal
          procedure: producing expert evidence under CrPR Part 33, challenging the prosecution&apos;s
          financial analysis, and providing credible evidence on POCA benefit and available assets.
        </p>
        <h2>Services for Criminal Defense</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>POCA confiscation benefit analysis: challenging the prosecution&apos;s benefit figure</li>

        <h2>SFO Investigations: How We Support Defense Teams</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Reviewing and challenging SFO financial analysis</li>
          <li>Section 2 interview preparation (financial aspects)</li>
          <li>Document review and financial reconstruction</li>
          <li>Parallel civil recovery proceedings analysis</li>
          <li>Expert witness reports for trial court</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DPA Negotiations: Quantifying the Exposure</h2>
        <p>
          For the first time, the SFO has stated explicitly that where a corporate self-reports
          suspected wrongdoing and fully cooperates, it can expect to be invited to negotiate a DPA
          rather than face prosecution (unless exceptional circumstances apply). Fraud forensic
          accountants quantify the scope of wrongdoing, the financial benefit to the organization,
          and the appropriate disgorgement figure: the foundation of any DPA financial settlement.
        </p>
        <h2>CrPR Part 33 Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          In criminal proceedings, expert witnesses are governed by Criminal Procedure Rules Part 33.
          Our experts produce CrPR Part 33 compliant reports with the required declaration of
          independence and objectivity.
